## Plugin Configuration Requirements

This plugin relies on the [GitHub Authentication Provider](https://backstage.io/docs/auth/github/provider) for its access to GitHub.

Search filter works the same way it works in GitHub, but `roadie-backstage-pull-requests/default-filter` annotation needs to be provided in component configuration. Adding a filter will result in applying that filter per default.

If this annotation is left out, no default filter will be applied when running the app.

## Install the plugin

```bash
cd packages/app
yarn add @roadiehq/backstage-plugin-github-pull-requests
```

## Add plugin API to your Backstage instance:

```ts
// packages/app/src/components/catalog/EntityPage.tsx
import {
  EntityGithubPullRequestsContent,
  isGithubPullRequestsAvailable,
} from '@roadiehq/backstage-plugin-github-pull-requests';
...

const serviceEntityPage = (
  <EntityLayout>
    ...
    <EntityLayout.Route
      path="/pull-requests"
      title="Pull Requests"
      // Uncomment the line below if you'd like to only show the tab on entities with the correct annotations already set
      // if={isGithubPullRequestsAvailable}
    >
      <EntityGithubPullRequestsContent />
    </EntityLayout.Route>
    ...
  </EntityLayout>
```

4. Run backstage app with `yarn start` and navigate to services tabs.

## Widget setup

...

const overviewContent = (
  <Grid container spacing={3}>
    ...
    <EntitySwitch>
      <EntitySwitch.Case if={isGithubPullRequestsAvailable}>
        <Grid item md={6}>
          <EntityGithubPullRequestsOverviewCard />
        </Grid>
      </EntitySwitch.Case>
    </EntitySwitch>
    ...
  </Grid>
);

```

## Group Widget setup

1. You must install plugin by following the steps above to add widget to your Group Entity Page

2. Add widget to your group page:

```ts
import {
  EntityGithubGroupPullRequestsCard,
  isGithubTeamPullRequestsAvailable,
} from '@roadiehq/backstage-plugin-github-pull-requests';

...

const groupPage = (
  <Grid container spacing={3}>
    ...
    <EntitySwitch>
      <EntitySwitch.Case if={isGithubTeamPullRequestsAvailable}>
        <Grid item md={5} xs={12}>
          <EntityGithubGroupPullRequestsCard/>
        </Grid>
      </EntitySwitch.Case>
    </EntitySwitch>
    ...
  </Grid>
);

```

## Add Homepage components to your homepage

![A preview image of the components](./docs/homepage-components.png)

If you didn't set up the HomePage plugin you can see the official documentation about it [here](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/plugins/home). You'll need to have it setup to be able to include this plugin.

A reasonable default will be used as a search term for both cards but you may have reasonable to provide your own query. This can be done through the `query` prop available for both cards.

**TIP**: You might want to filter by a specific Github org if you have users who share a single Github account for work and personal usage.

You can build up a query using [Github Advanced Search](https://github.com/search/advanced) and once you hit "Search", the query in the search bar is what you'll want to provide as your query prop.

```tsx
//packages/app/src/components/home/HomePage.tsx

import {
  HomePageRequestedReviewsCard,
  HomePageYourOpenPullRequestsCard,
} from '@roadiehq/backstage-plugin-github-pull-requests';


export const HomePage = () => {
  return (
    ...

      <Grid item md={6} xs={12}>
        <HomePageRequestedReviewsCard />
      </Grid>

      <Grid item md={6} xs={12}>
        <HomePageYourOpenPullRequestsCard query="org:RoadieHQ is:pr language:CSS" />
      </Grid>
    ...
  );
};
```

## Features

- List Pull Requests for your repository, with filtering and search (The searchbar is working like in github).
- Show basic statistics widget about pull requests for your repository.
- Possibility to add a variable on the backstage configuration of a catalog entity allowing to add a default search filter on github pull requests

# New Frontend System

Follow these steps to detect and configure the GitHub Pull Requests plugin if you'd like to use it in an application that supports the new Backstage frontend system.

## Package Detection

Once you install the `@roadiehq/backstage-plugin-github-pull-requests` package using your preferred package manager, you have to choose how the package should be detected by the app. The package can be automatically discovered when the feature discovery config is set, or it can be manually enabled via code (for more granular package customization cases).

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Via config</td>
    <td>Via code</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre lang="yaml">
        <code>
# app-config.yaml
  app:
    # Enable package discovery for all plugins
    packages: 'all'
  ---
  app:
    # Enable package discovery only for GitHub Pull Requests
    packages:
      include:
        - '@roadiehq/backstage-plugin-github-pull-requests'
        </code>
      </pre>
    </td>
    <td>
      <pre lang="javascript">
       <code>
// packages/app/src/App.tsx
import { createApp } from '@backstage/frontend-defaults';
import githubPullRequestsPlugin from '@roadiehq/backstage-plugin-github-pull-requests/alpha';
//...
const app = createApp({
  // ...
  features: [
    //...
    githubPullRequestsPlugin,
  ],
});

//...
</code>
</pre>
</td>

  </tr>
</table>

### Extensions Configuration

Currently, the plugin installs 3 extensions: one api, one entity page card and one entity page content (also known as entity page tab), see below examples of how to configure the available extensions.

```yml
# app-config.yaml
app:
  extensions:
    # Example disabling the GitHub Pull Requests entity card
    - 'entity-card:github-pull-requests': false
    # Example customizing the GitHub Pull Requests entity card
    - 'entity-card:github-pull-requests':
        config:
          variant: 'gridItem' # or flex / fullHeight
    # Example disabling the GitHub Pull Requests  entity content
    - 'entity-content:github-pull-requests': false
    # Example customizing the GitHub Pull Requests  entity content
    - 'entity-content:github-pull-requests':
        config:
          path: '/pull-requests'
          title: 'Pull Requests'
```
