## 4.0.1

### Patch Changes

- a83e7e9: Tidy unused plugin depdendencies.

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- 58b87ce: Fix: No longer expecting winston logger types for router. This may cause type errors in development.

  BREAKING CHANGE:

  We have extracted the argo cd service into its own service factory/reference. The change was made to enable dependency injection of the argocd service into the router. Dependency injection helps with testing the functionality of the code more easily. Service factories also have several checks that backstage validates at startup - like those that prevent circular depednencies, and validation on dependencies missing.

  This is a breaking change because if you are using the new backend system, you will need to now import the argocd service in your `backend/index.ts` file like this:

  ```typescript
  import { argocdServiceFactory } from '@roadiehq/backstage-plugin-argo-cd-backend';

  backend.add(argocdServiceFactory); // NEW!! Import Service Factory
  backend.add(import('@roadiehq/backstage-plugin-argo-cd-backend/alpha')); // Import Plugin
  ```

  If you are using the legacy backend service, then you will have to create the router passing in the argo cd service, which is already made available:

  ```typescript
  export default async function createPlugin({
    logger,
    config,
  }: PluginEnvironment) {
    console.log('ArgoCD plugin is initializing');
    const argoUserName =
      config.getOptionalString('argocd.username') ?? 'argocdUsername';
    const argoPassword =
      config.getOptionalString('argocd.password') ?? 'argocdPassword';
    return createRouter({
      logger,
      config,
      argocdService: new ArgoService(
        argoUserName,
        argoPassword,
        config,
        logger,
      ), // you must now pass the argo service
    });
  }
  ```

## 3.3.2

### Patch Changes

- eb5a107: removing old way of starting app locally, to new way of starting app locally.

## 3.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 2bf0fa2: Adding the `resources-finalizer.argocd.argoproj.io` finalizer when creating a project. This allows the ability to delete the project first without getting stuck when deleting the application afterwards. This fix will allow the application to delete and not get stuck deleting.

## 3.3.0

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 04b7788: #### New Feature âœ¨

  - **New Endpoint!**: Terminate Application Operation endpoint is a proxy to the [argocd terminate application operation functionality](https://cd.apps.argoproj.io/swagger-ui#operation/ApplicationService_TerminateOperation).

    ```
    DELETE /argoInstance/:argoInstanceName/applications/:argoAppName/operation
    ```

  - **New query parameter!**: We introduced the ability to terminate your application's current operation prior to deleting the application and project. Argo applications will not delete if there is an operation in progress. We now allow the ability to terminate the current operation so that deleting can happened immediately.

    ```
    DELETE /argoInstance/:argoInstanceName/applications/:argoAppName?terminateOperation=true
    ```

  - **Wait Interval configuration flag**: Often deleting the argo application takes time - it is not always immediate. In fact, the request to delete an application is queued in argo. Consequently, an argo project cannot delete if the application is still pending deletion. To combat this, we chose to wait for the deletion of the application to complete, by doing 5 checks and waiting for 5 seconds inbetween each check, totaling for 25 seconds in waiting for the application to be deleted before attempting to delete the project. We **do not** do this anymore. Our default is to **NOT** check more than once, and allow for the wait interval between each check to be configurable. You can now configure the wait interval time (in ms). You can still configure the amount of checks. Please look at plugin's readme for more information and updates.

    ```yml
    argocd:
      waitInterval: 1000 # time in ms, optional number, default is 5000ms
      waitCycles: 2 # number of checks, optional number, default is to check 1 time with no wait time
    ```

  #### BREAKING CHANGES ðŸ’¥

  - We are no longer waiting for an application to delete prior to attempting to delete a project due to the wait interval, wait cycle, and terminate operation changes. More details on these added features are in the above section. If you would like the same checking effect as before, you may adjust your `waitCycles` configuration value to be 5 (as this was the previous default check count). This affects the `DELETE /argoInstance/:argoInstanceName/applications/:argoAppName` route.

  - Response Change: The route for deleting an argocd application and project response has changed.

    `DELETE /argoInstance/:argoInstanceName/applications/:argoAppName`

    We introduced a new key (`terminateOperationDetails`) to the object that normally returns from the endpoint above, and changes to the original response names.

    Below is the type for reference. Please look at the commit to determine what the previous response was.

    ```typescript
    type ArgoErrorResponse = {
      message: string;
      error: string;
      code: number;
    };

    type DeleteResponse =
      | (ArgoErrorResponse & { statusCode: Exclude<HttpStatusCodes, 200> })
      | { statusCode: 200 };

    type status = 'pending' | 'success' | 'failed';

    type ResponseSchema<T> = {
      status: status;
      message: string;
      argoResponse: T;
    };

    type ResponseSchemaUnknown = {
      status: Extract<status, 'failed'>;
      message: string;
      argoResponse: Record<string, never>;
    };

    type DeleteApplicationAndProjectResponse = {
      terminateOperationDetails?: ResponseSchema<DeleteResponse> | undefined;
      deleteAppDetails:
        | ResponseSchema<DeleteResponse | ArgoApplication>
        | undefined;
      deleteProjectDetails:
        | ResponseSchema<DeleteResponse>
        | ResponseSchemaUnknown
        | undefined;
    };
    ```

  Please look at plugin's readme and the commit for more information on response type changes.
