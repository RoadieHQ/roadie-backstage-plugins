# Glean Backend

Welcome to the Glean backend plugin!

This backend plugin is used to make our Backstage content available in
[Glean](https://glean.com/) — our internal search engine.

## Getting started

This plugin has been added to the main backend app in this repository, meaning
you'll be able to access it by running `yarn start-backend` in the root
directory, and then make requests to
[http://localhost:7007/api/glean](http://localhost:7007/api/glean).
