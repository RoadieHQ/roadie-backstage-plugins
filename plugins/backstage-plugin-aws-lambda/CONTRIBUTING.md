# Contributing to the Backstage AWS Lambda plugin

We want the Backstage AWS Lambda plugin to become the best possible AWS Lambda plugin for Backstage. This is an ambitious goal, and we can't do it without the support of the community.

Therefore we want to create strong community of contributors -- all working together to create the kind of delightful experience that Backstage deserves.

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given. ❤️

The Backstage AWS Lambda plugin is released under the Apache 2.0 License, and original creations contributed to this repo are accepted under the same license.

We aim to stick as closely as possible to the [contribution guidelines which apply to the Backstage project](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). If something is not covered in this document, please assume that the appropriate Backstage guideline will apply. 

## Types of Contributions

### Report bugs

No one likes bugs. Report bugs as an issue [here](https://github.com/RoadieHQ/backstage-plugin-aws-lambda/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_template.md).

### Fix bugs or build new features

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs or problems that other users are having. If you're having a problem yourself, feel free to contribute a fix for us to review.

### Submit feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file [an issue](https://github.com/RoadieHQ/backstage-plugin-aws-lambda/issues/new).

If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Explain the wider context about what you are trying to achieve.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)

### Add your company to ADOPTERS

Have you started using the Backstage AWS Lambda plugin. Adding your company to [ADOPTERS](https://github.com/RoadieHQ/backstage-plugin-aws-lambda/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md) really helps the project.

## Get Started!

So...feel ready to jump in? Let's do this. 💯 👏

Start by reading the plugin README to get set up for local development. If you need help, just jump into [our Discord chatroom](https://discord.gg/W3qEMhmx4f).

## Coding Guidelines

We use the backstage-cli to build, serve, lint, test and package this plugin, just like the plugins which live within the Backstage monorepo in the `/plugins` directory. 

Also, the `tsconfig.json` simply extends the upstream `@backstage/cli/config/tsconfig.json`.

As such, the [same coding guidelines mostly apply](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#coding-guidelines).

## Merging to main

Plugins are automatically published when a version bump is merged to the `main` branch. Please include version bumps with your pull requests if you would like them to be released.

## Code of Conduct

We subscribe to the [Spotify FOSS code of conduct](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which is used by the Backstage project.

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior—or have any other concerns—please report it by contacting us via [foss@roadie.io](mailto:foss@roadie.io).
